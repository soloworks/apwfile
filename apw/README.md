# apwfile : Go package for AMX Netlinx .apw files

## Overview

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/soloworks/go-netlinx/apw?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/soloworks/go-netlinx/apw)

This package allows reading, manipulation and creation of AMX (Harman) Netlinx  Studio workspace (.apw) files in Go. This is used by various internal tools and is in development so should only be considered semi-stable.

It was created to provide an easy way to package and edit workspaces with go based scripting tools.

## Install

```
go get github.com/soloworks/go-netlinx/apw
```
